Design goals:

- Feeling of being self-hosted and handmade, like Cliff Stoll's website
- Self-hosted, from my basement, on the NAS
- Can serve as public homepage for myself
- Can upload and serve files of arbitary size and type, not tracked by git (NAS?)
- Dynamic elements on site, with a DB stored locally on the filesystem (Zephyr style)
- Support for a backend in multiple lanaguges (maybe something kind of like CGI scripts?)

Ideas:

public/<files in repo alongside files on NAS>
db/
/<app folders>
ROUTES<mapping and runtimes specified>
