Design goals:

- Feeling of being handmade, like Cliff Stoll's website
- Can serve as public homepage for myself professionally
- Easily publish notes w/ accountability system (Scrapbook / GitHub streak style)

To do:

- [ ] Sort list of posts by edit time
- [ ] Show publish time of post
- [ ] Show most recent edit time of post
- [ ] Make sure it works for posts in subfolders, and sub-sub(and sub-sub-sub...) folders
